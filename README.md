Trees of Life
=============

A Unity3D game made in [Global Game Jam 2016](https://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/trees-life) by Aydin Arik and Timo Bleeker.

Instructions
------------
Plant as many trees as you can and keep them safe from harm. There are no winners or losers - only those that care for the environment. Our ritual is all in the process.

To play the game, move your Planter and let it throw seeds. Then move your Grower to allow seeds to transform into trees. The Defender has an area attack that damages and stops enemies in it's vicinity. Note, the enemies (white) attacks and destroys trees.

Basic Controls are with the keyboard and mouse. Key '1' selects the Defender (Blue), '2' selects the Grower (Green) and '3' - Planter (Red). Left mouse button can be used also for selection either directly on player or on the UI icons. Right mouse button action on the map moves the players around the map.
